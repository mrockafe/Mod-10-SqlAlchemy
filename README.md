# Mod-10-SqlAlchemy
Hawaii climate analysis

## Description

In this module I used python, SQL Alchemy, and Flask to create an analysis of weather stations and the climate as a whole in Hawaii. 
The data was stored in an SQL database that was already provided (hawaii.sqlite)
We were able to use this data and pull it in within our code in Jupyter Lab (climate_starter.ipynb)
From here I used python and pandas to complet our analysis from the data from the weather stations. 
Some graphs were made via matplotlib library for better visulization and the data is exported to csv sheets in the reasources folder.
Now we are clear to move o nto the python file using Flask and API's to route different paths(app.py).
Onces these routes are created and the database is linked we can run all of the repository.

## Directions

In order to use and test this repository the first step is to clone this repository to your local drive. 
climate_starter.ipynb is a jupyter file that can be accessed and tested within jupyter lab from start to finish
Once completed you may proced to run app.py in your terminal
    open your terminal to the files location and enter; python app.py
All file paths are relative and can be used without any name changes once properly cloned.
